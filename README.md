A working **local stack** of the StateSet iCommerce protocol — contracts, bridges, demos, schemas — runnable on your machine in five minutes.

> Verifiable agent commerce: a buyer's AI agent → x402 PaymentIntent → on-chain escrow → STARK-proven compliance → settlement → tamper-proof receipt. All audit-able from a cold start.

This repo is **the runnable subset**. For the full platform (sequencer, MCP tooling, admin UI), see [`stateset/icommerce-app`](https://github.com/stateset/icommerce-app).

---

## 5-minute start

Prerequisites: [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (`anvil`, `forge`, `cast`), Node 20+, and the [stateset-sequencer](https://github.com/stateset/stateset-sequencer) + [stateset-starks](https://github.com/stateset/stateset-starks) repos cloned with `cargo build --release` (only the latter is required for receipt verification — the sequencer is optional unless you run the agent-receipt demo).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stateset/icommerce-quickstart && cd icommerce-quickstart

# 0. One-time: install Solidity + Node deps
bash stack/setup.sh

# 1. Bring everything up: anvil + deploy + bridges
./stack/stateset up

# 2. Watch the protocol settle a $1500 order end-to-end
./stack/stateset demo lifecycle

# 3. Verify the produced receipt independently
./stack/stateset demo verify demos/fixtures/agent-receipt.json
```

> Want to see what each command's output should look like before running? See [`docs/EXAMPLE_RUN.md`](./docs/EXAMPLE_RUN.md).

That's it. You now have a working StateSet iCommerce stack on your machine.

## What's in the box

| **[`schemas/`](./schemas)** | The 3 JSON Schemas: agent-receipt.v1, compliance-bundle.v1, cross-border-receipt.v1 |
| **[`stack/`](./stack)** | First-time `setup.sh` + the `stateset` CLI orchestrator (21 subcommands; see [CLI reference](#cli-reference)) |

| **[`scripts/`](./scripts)** | `release.sh` (tag → push → GitHub release) + `install-hooks.sh` (pre-commit) |

## The escrow lifecycle demo

The simplest possible end-to-end test of the stack. ~120 lines of ethers + the deployed contracts:

```
buyer wallet ──[approve]──► SSDC
buyer wallet ──[lock]─────► OrderEscrow  (Status: Locked)
buyer wallet ─[markDelivered]► OrderEscrow  (Status: Delivered)
seller wallet ─[release]──► OrderEscrow  (Status: Released)
                                         │
                                         └──► seller receives SSDC
```

> **Why the buyer marks delivered, not the seller**: `OrderEscrow.markDelivered` requires `msg.sender == buyer || operator` — recipient confirms delivery, not sender. The seller can't unilaterally claim delivery happened. Caught by the e2e CI gate in iter-9 of this repo's history.

Run it:

```bash
./stack/stateset demo lifecycle
ORDER_USD=500 ./stack/stateset demo lifecycle    # custom amount
```

Output is a sequence of ✓ checkmarks with tx hashes you can paste into `cast` to inspect.

## The real-money loop demo

`bank → Stripe webhook → SSDC mint → OrderEscrow → release → SSDC pull → Stripe Treasury intent`

Single command, full multi-currency. Tokyo buyer paying JPY, London seller withdrawing GBP:

```bash
./stack/stateset demo realmoney --currency JPY --payout-currency GBP
```

The bridges talk to the on-chain `FxOracle` for both legs, so an auditor can replay the exact rate at the recorded `updatedAt`.

## The verifier demo

Three layers of independent verification — schema, on-chain, STARK:

```bash
./stack/stateset demo verify demos/fixtures/agent-receipt.json
```

No StateSet-operated server. The trust roots are: the JSON Schemas (in this repo), your RPC URL, and the open-source `ves-stark` binary (build it from [stateset-starks](https://github.com/stateset/stateset-starks)).

For Node + Python verifier libraries you can `npm install` / `pip install` into your own apps:

```bash
npm install @stateset/verify-receipt
pip install stateset-verify-receipt
```

---

## Running the tests

```bash
./stack/stateset test            # everything (needs anvil up for e2e)
./stack/stateset gates           # everything that doesn't need a chain (preview a CI push)
```

CI runs four kinds of tests on every push:

| Layer | What | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **`forge test`** in `contracts/` | OrderEscrow, FxOracle, NAVOracle, SetRegistry, SetPaymaster, SetPaymentBatch | **216** |
| **`npm test`** in `bridges/` | HMAC, secp256k1, replay rejection, multi-currency, lazy-load | **35** |
| **schema validation** (`validate-fixture.mjs`) | bundled fixture against `agent-receipt.v1.schema.json` | **1** |
| **e2e demos** (`escrow-lifecycle` + `realmoney-loop` USD + JPY→GBP) | full multi-process cycle with **17 invariant assertions** across 3 runs | **3 runs** |

Bridge tests run **standalone with no chain** — they exercise the pure verification functions (signature recovery, message canonicalization, cross-currency replay rejection).

Contract gas usage is tracked in [`contracts/.gas-snapshot`](./contracts/.gas-snapshot); regressions show as line diffs in PRs. Use `stateset bench:diff` locally to preview.

## What you don't get from this repo

- **Sequencer** ([stateset/stateset-sequencer](https://github.com/stateset/stateset-sequencer)) — Rust service for canonical event ordering. Build with `cargo build --release` from that repo.
- **STARK verifier binary** ([stateset/stateset-starks](https://github.com/stateset/stateset-starks)) — `ves-stark` CLI. Same drill.
- **MCP tools** — for AI agents driving the stack. Lives in the main monorepo.
- **Admin UI** — Next.js operator dashboard. Lives in the main monorepo.
- **Receipt generator** — the agent-receipt demo that mints a full STARK-proven receipt depends on the sequencer + the monorepo's sync engine. To produce real receipts, use the main `icommerce-app` repo.

This repo is the **runnable protocol layer**. The platform layer lives upstream.
